description=Combine GPS measurements with a thick network of mutual distance to get more and better 2D point locations.
version=0.4

about=This plugin solves the problem of estimating accurate positions for trees under a thick canopy, or for locations where high resolution aereal photos are not available.
  Points need a 'id' property, and the measured mutual distances need be in metres.
  Mutual distances are given in the form of a CVS table, three fields: from, to, distance.
  The plugin offers two functionalities, one in which you ultimately trust the given geographic references and calculate the other positions from these reference points and using the mutual distances network; one in which you do not ultimately trust the GPS measurements, and you wish to correct them using a thick mutual distances network.
  In the first case points are added to the vector layer containing the initial few reference points; in the second case the GPS measurements are on a read-only layer and the points are added to a second layer.
